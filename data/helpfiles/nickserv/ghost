Syntax: GHOST nickname

Terminates a "ghost" IRC session using your nick.  A
"ghost" session is one which is not actually connected,
but which the IRC server believes is still online for one
reason or another.  Typically, this happens if your
computer crashes or your Internet or modem connection
goes down for a short period of time while you're on IRC.

In order to use the GHOST command for a nick, your
current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick's
access list.
