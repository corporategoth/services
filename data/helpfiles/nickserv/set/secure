Syntax: SET SECURE {ON|OFF}

Turns NickServ's security features on or off for your
nick.  With SECURE set, you must enter your password
before you will be recognized as the owner of the nick,
regardless of whether your address is on the access
list.  However, if you are on the access list, NickServ
will not auto-kill you regardless of the setting of the
KILL option.
