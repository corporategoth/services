Syntax: RECOVER nickname

Allows you to recover your nickname if someone else has
taken it; this does the same thing that NickServ does
automatically if someone steals a kill-protected nick.

When you give this command, NickServ will bring a fake
user online with the same nickname as the user you're
trying to recover your nick from.  This causes the IRC
servers to disconnect the other user.  NickServ's fake
user will remain online for one minute to ensure that the
other user does not immediately reconnect; after that
minute, you can reclaim your nick.  Alternatively, use
the RELEASE command (/msg NickServ HELP RELEASE) to get
the nick back sooner.

In order to use the RECOVER command for a nick, your
current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick's
access list.
