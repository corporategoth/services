Syntax: RELEASE nickname
Instructs NickServ to remove any hold on your nickname
caused by automatic kill protection or use of the RECOVER
command.  By default, such holds last for one minute;
this command gets rid of them sooner.

In order to use the RELEASE command for a nick, your
current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick's
access list.
