        ACCESS LIST

Modifies or displays the access list for your nick.  This
is the list of addresses which will be automatically

you want to use the nick from a different address, you
need to send an IDENTIFY command to make NickServ
recognize you.

Examples:

    ACCESS ADD *prez@*.srealm.net.au
        Allows access to user prez from any machine in
        the srealm.net.au domain.

    ACCESS DEL *prez@*.srealm.net.au
        Reverses the previous command.

    ACCESS LIST
        Displays the current access list.
