Syntax: DEL [channel] {num|ALL}

If a number num is given, deletes that memo from your
memo list.  If ALL is given, deletes all of your memos.
If channel is specified, it does it for the channel
instead.  If a channel is defined, this funtion is
restricted to level 15 for your own memos, and 25
for other user's or ALL.
