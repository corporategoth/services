MemoServ is a utility allowing IRC users to send short
messages to other IRC users, whether they are online at
the time or not, or channels for all that enter to see.
Both sender and recipient must have their nicknames
registered with NickServ in order to send a memo, or
if the recipiant is a channel,  it must be registered
with ChanServ.

MemoServ's commands include:

    SEND    Send a memo to a nick/channel
    LIST    List all of your or a channel's memos
    READ    Read a memo (or all memos)
    FORWARD Forward a memo to a nick/channel
    DEL     Delete a memo (or all memos)

Type /msg MemoServ HELP command for help on any of the
above commands.

Note that any channel news items over three weeks old will
automatically be erased.
