Syntax: SET channel MLOCK modes

Sets the mode-lock parameter for the channel.  ChanServ
allows you to define certain channel modes to be always
on (or off).  The modes that can be locked are i, k, l,
m, n, p, s, and t; each of these modes can be locked on,
locked off, or not locked.  The <modes> parameter is
constructed exactly the same way as a /MODE command; that
is, modes followed by a + are locked on, and modes
followed by a - are locked off.

Examples:

    SET #channel MLOCK +nt-iklps
       Forces modes n and t on, and modes i, k, l, p, and
       s off.  Mode m is left free to be either on or off.

    SET #channel MLOCK +knst-ilmp my-key
       Forces modes k, n, s, and t on, and modse i, l, m,
       and p off.  Also forces the channel key to be
       "my-key".

    SET #channel MLOCK +
       Removes the mode lock; all channel modes are free
       to be either on or off.
