Syntax: SET channel SECURE {ON|OFF}

Enables or disables ChanServ's security features for a
channel.  When SECURE is set, only users who have
registered their nicknames with NickServ and IDENTIFY'd
with their password will be given access to the channel
as controlled by the access list.  Note that the access
list may only contain registered nicknames if SECURE is set.
