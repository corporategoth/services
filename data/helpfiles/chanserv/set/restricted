Syntax: SET channel RESTRICTED {ON|OFF}

Enables or disables the restricted access option for a
channel.  When restricted access is set, users who would
normally be disallowed from having channel operator
privileges (users with negative access levels and, if
secure ops is set, users not on the access list) will
instead be kicked and banned from the channel.
