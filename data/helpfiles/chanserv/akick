Syntax: AKICK channel ADD mask [reason]
        AKICK channel DEL mask
        AKICK channel LIST [mask]

Maintains the AutoKick list for a channel.  If a user
on the AutoKick list attempts to join the channel,
ChanServ will ban that user from the channel, then kick
the user.

The AKICK ADD command adds the given nick or usermask
to the AutoKick list.  If a reason is given with
the command, that reason will be used when the user is
kicked; if not, the default reason is "You have been
banned from the channel".

The AKICK DEL command removes the given nick or mask
from the AutoKick list.  It does not, however, remove any
bans placed by an AutoKick; those must be removed
manually.

The AKICK LIST command displays the AutoKick list, or
optionally only those AutoKick entries which match the
given mask.
