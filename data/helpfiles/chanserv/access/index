Maintains the access list for a channel.  The access
list specifies which users are allowed chanop status or
access to ChanServ commands on the channel.  Different
user levels allow for access to different subsets of
privileges; /msg ChanServ HELP ACCESS LEVELS for more
specific information.  By default, any nick not on the
access list has a user level of 0.

The ACCESS ADD command adds the given nickname or
usermask to the access list with the given user level; if
the nick or mask is already present on the list, its
access level is changed to the level specified in the
command.

The ACCESS DEL command removes the given nick or mask
from the access list.

The ACCESS LIST command displays the access list; if
a mask is given, only those entries matching the mask are
displayed.
