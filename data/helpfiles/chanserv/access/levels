User access levels

There are currently five distinct access levels
available:

Founder   Full access to ChanServ functions; automatic
                  opping upon entering channel.  Note
                  that only one person may have founder
                  status (it cannot be given using the
                  ACCESS command).
     25   Access to change all SET commands except
                  FOUNDER and PASSWORD.
     20   Access to AKICK and CLEAR commands.
     15   Access to posting Channel NEWS.
     10   Automatic opping.
      5   Automatic voicing.
      0   No special privileges; can be opped by other
                  ops (unless secure-ops is set).
     <0   May not be opped.

In addition, any user with access level greater than zero
can add other users to the access list, as long as the new
entries are for levels less than the user's own.  So, for
example, a level 10 user can add level 5 users, and either
a level 10 or a level 5 user can add negative-level users.
Founders can add users at any level they want.
