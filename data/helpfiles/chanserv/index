ChanServ allows you to register and control various
aspects of channels.  ChanServ can often prevent
malicious users from "taking over" channels by limiting
who is allowed channel operator priviliges.  ChanServ's
commands are listed below; to use them, type
/msg ChanServ <command>.  For more information on a
specific command, type /msg ChanServ help command.

Note that any channel which is not used for two weeks
(i.e. which no user on the channel's access list enters
for that period of time) will be automatically dropped.
