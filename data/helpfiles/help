HelpServ is a service designed to give out information on
IRC and DarkerNet itself.  It has relatively few commands at 
the moment, but the helpfiles are being written currently.  
As of now, it has three commands:

    LISTADMIN - Lists the Services staff
    SERVER - Retrieves info on the server specified
    RULES - Guidelines & info about DarkerNet
    CREDITS - Services credits (author info + thanks to)

More commands will be added as helpfiles are written.
