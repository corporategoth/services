Rules on DarkerNet/General IRC etiquette:

  * Do not flood.  Flooding is repeatedly /msging a user 
    with junk in an attempt to knock them off of the net.

  * Do not clone.  Running clonebots just to hog up 
    connections or flood a user will not be tolerated. 
    Some servers have limited bandwidth and we want it
    saved for users.

  * If you forget a password, don't be embarrassed.
    Do a /msg HelpServ LISTADMIN and send a msg or
    memo to one of those people.  They'll be glad to
    help.

  * Please do not participate in any illegal/immoral
    activities.  DarkerNet does not exist to 
    facilitate trafficking of illegal things, i.e.
    child pornography, pirated software (`warez'),
    et cetera.

  * Do a /msg HelpServ SERVER <servername> or 
    /motd servername to find out the server's bot
    policy, if you wish to run a bot there. 

Just be courteous and have fun chatting. :)
