 *     - IRCOP_OVERRIDE allows IrcOP's to use the chanserv OP, DEOP,
 *       VOICE, DEVOICE, INVITE and UNBAN functions, and SOPs to use
 *       the chanserv CLEAR.  In both cases regardless of ACCESS list
 *       (hense the term OVERRIDE).
 *     - MEMOS activates USER memos.
 *     - NEWS activates CHANNEL memos.
 *     - AKILL activates the Auto KILL list.
 *     - CLONES activates the internal clone detection/noticing.
